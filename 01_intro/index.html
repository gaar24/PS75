<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> This week assignment was to brainstorm ideas for the final project, and create a website to document out the progress done daily assignments. </p>

<h1> Building the Webiste </h1>
<p> I started by using the templete provided, and had to constantly seek for help as I did not know how to program in html. During my weekends, I decided to watch several youtube tutorials on html and learn how to build a website from scratch, as I truly wanted to build my own one. For that, I started by creating a new repository in GitHub, and then did a file (this time called "PS75"), and began the process! There was times throughout my website devlopment that stressed me out, but at the end it turn to be better than I expected. </p>

<h1> First Proposal (The final i selected) </h1>
<p> I started by figuring out something I would be most passioante about. Later, I thought of the challenge part that could be involved in my mechanism. My first idea, was to create a phone charger with a solar pannel implemented so that the battery could be easily charge while being in the road or miles away from home. The way it would work is that it will be a small device in a circular shape where instead of a wire attached to the phone, the phone would be charged by placing the phone on the surface of the charger. Below I attached an image on how the design would look like, s well as its correspodning implememtation. </p>

<h1> Update 13 of July 2023  </h1>

<p> Finally, I decided to do a phone charger, and so I was thinking that only the ability to charge the phone is simple, and wanted to implement additional inputs and outputs. For outputs, I was thinking of sort of incorporating an LED that is able to show the battery level, and potentially the implementation of a charging coil that is wireless. For inputs, I wanted to implement a temperature sensor so that we can monitor the chargers temperature to prevent overheating. 



<h1> Second Proposal (Not anymore) </h1>
<p> My second idea was to build an automatic water system. I believe that sometimes there is not enough time to get the plants watered, and thta could led to catastrophes. For that, I thought of  adding as potw here the tubes areconnected through it in a way that seems to give water. It would be a simulation of how it will distribute the water, and the times it will lastand stop.</p>
