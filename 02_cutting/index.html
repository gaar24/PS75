<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 220%; height: 1.5%;" > Assignment </h1>
<p> This week assignment we had to create a press-fit construction kit tha could be assemble in multiple ways accounting for the use of the lasercutter kerf. Furthermore, we had to select 2 household objects or components from the lab and model them in CAD. </p>

<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 220%; height: 1.5%;"> Press-Fit Construction Kit </h1>

<h1> Materials Used </h1>
<p> Cardboard, Calipers, Fusion 360, and Inkscape Software </p>


<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p> I decided to do my press-fit construction kit of wheels that could be assembled together to sort of do a prototype that ended up looking like a sort of drone. To be really honest, I didnt had a specific shape I wanted to lassercut, but ended up with a circle with several notches by being inspired by other designs in google. </p>

<h1>  Using Fusion 360</h1>

<p> Before I could even start designing, I really had to make sure that I did know how to use Fusion 360, and for that decided to watch several youtube videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A&list=RDCMUCooViVfi0DaWk_eqxIXXiOQ&start_radio=1&rv=d3qGQ2utl2A&t=0"> here </a> that served me as an inspirational source to come up with my ideal shape. After building my knwoledge with this program, started to build my shape. What I first did was to create a skecth, and chose the "top plane". Followed by this, draw a circle that had a diamter of 50mm. </p>

<p> Afterwards, proceed to divide my circle into eight evenly distribuited pieces by creating construction lines along the x and y axes by pressing " Control + L". </p>

<p> Once I had this, I offlined this traced lines by 1.9mm and mirror them. Finally,  I extrude my shape and chose a thickness of 3.8 mm. </p>

<h1> 2. Using Inkscape + Laser Printing </h1>

<p> Once I finished with my design and ensure it was as I wanted to be, I went ahead and exported the skecth to a DXF file. Then, imported the DXF file into Inkscape, where I changed the color of the lines from black to red so that it could be more visible. After this adjustments, exported this sketch to a PDF and opened it with adobe in the computer lcoated in the lab. I had to follow the instructions provided it in the wall as I didnt know how to use this new artifact, which took me more than expected. Here, I selected the number of pieces I wanted (in my case 10)  and created it a grid of 5 x 2. Lastly, I selected the material "cardboard" and chose the thickness of the material, which was 3.8mm that I measured with the help of callipers. Printing time!! </p>

<h1> Final Product </h1>

<p> This is the final result of the pieces assembled. I would definetely say it took me around -5min to print my pieces. The wheels definetely proceeded to come the way that I expected and perfectly fit into each other on the second try! </p>

<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 220%; height: 1.5%;"> Modelling Household Objects- Water Bottle  </h1>

<h1> Materials </h1>
<P> callipers, Water bottle, Fusion 360. </p>

<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p> I always carry my water bottle with me, and so thought it would be cool to sketched it in 2D. </p>


<h1> 1. Dimensions + Drawings </h1>
<p> I started by drawing a schematic representation with all measures of the parts I wanted to include in my design. I followed the measurements of my actaul water bottle, and so I did the bottom with a diamter of 7cm and the top diameter of 3cm. For the body, it had a height of 15cm and the part that connects the height with the top, 5cm.  </p>

<h1> 2. Building Procedure </h1>

<p> For this, I began by making circles and then filleting the bottom part of the water bottle, and then created a hole in the top part to represent the water bottle being open. Then, I added some decorative elements. I went on and gave a glass material effect and then added gold and black as my main colors. </p>



<h1> 3. Final Product</h1>
<p> This is my water bottle with all its feature included. </p>

<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 220%; height: 1.5%;"> Moddelling Household Objects- Lab Screwdriver  </h1>

<h1> Materials </h1>

<p> callipers, screwdriver, fusion 360. </p>

<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> This design idea came while I was waiting to use the lasercutter kerd. I was standing in there and found a screwdriver and surprisingly calipers, so I went ahead and proceed to do a 2D modelling. </p>


<h1> 1. Dimensions + Drawings </h1>
<p> I started by drawing a schematic representation with all measures of the parts I wanted to include in my design after using callipers. </p>

<h1> 2. Building Procedure </h1>

<p> I started by doing the body in the form of a cylinder, and then continue on to create the holder and eventually the screw. My screw driver was 5.5mmm. Below, I have attached a picture of how it is simmulated. </p>

<h1> 3. Final Product</h1>
<p> Finally, I gave my screwdriver some color of yellow and black, and done! </p>
