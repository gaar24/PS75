<h1> Week 3 : Electronics and Tools </h1>
<p> For this week's assignment we had to create a kinetic structure that was able to be moved through a circuitry. Then, used a multimeter to measure the voltages in the circuit. Use Ohm's Law to calculate current through the circuit. Document your work and learning. Include at least one video/ gif of the sculpture. </p>

<h4> Materials Used </h4>
- Calipers 
- Screwdriver 
- Screw 
- Wood
- Motor 
- Breadboard circuit 
- Fusion 360
- Arduino 
- Potentiometer 
- Hot glue 
- Creativity 

<h4> Introduction </h4>

Since we had to create a kinetic structure, and is summer meaning warm weather, I decided to use the opportunity to create something useful that I could use and benefit from it. So, decided to go ahead and do a fan.


<h4> 1. Dimensions + Drawings </h4>
I started by drawing a schematic representation with all measures of the parts I wanted to include in my design.

<h4> 2. Building Procedure </h4>

 I started by doing the body in the form of a cylinder, and then continue on to create the holder and eventually the screw. My screw driver was 5.5mmm. Below, I have attached a picture of how it is simmulated.



<h4> 3. Final Product</h4>
Finally, I gave my screwdriver some color of yellow and black, and done!
