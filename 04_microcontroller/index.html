<h1> True or False </h1>
<p> For this week's assignment we had to program an Arduino board to do something. It should include a code snippets in the documnetation, a drawn schematic of the circuit using hand sketch, flastad or others. </p>

<h1> Press-Fit Construction Kit </h1>

<h1> Materials Used </h1>
<p> -Arduino - Wires - Breadboard - Button x2 - Green Light - Red Light </p>


<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p> Since I had the option to program an Arduino Board to do something, I thought it would be really cool to do a true or false game, and decided to build on that. i decidied to not associated to my kientic structure as I thought it would better for me to understand arduino and further epand my knowledge in it so that I am able to later perform more complex projects that involve the use of other mechanisms. </p>

<h1> Schematic </h1>

<P> </P>

<h1> Code </h1>

<p> This is the code that I used for my  </p>



<h1> Testing its Effectiveness </h1>

<p> This is the final result of the pieces assembled. I would definetely say it took me around -5min to print my pieces. The wheels definetely proceeded to come the way that I expected and perfectly fit into each other on the second try! </p>
