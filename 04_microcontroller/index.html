<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 220%; height: 3%;"> Assignment </h1>
<p> For this week's assignment we had to program an Arduino board to do something. It should include a code snippets in the documnetation, a drawn schematic of the circuit using hand sketch, flastad or others. </p>

<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 220%; height: 3%;"> "True or False"  </h1>

<h1> Materials Used </h1>
<p> -Arduino - Wires - Breadboard - Button x2 - Green Light - Red Light </p>


<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p> Since I had the option to program an Arduino Board to do something, I thought it would be really cool to do a true or false game, and decided to build on that. i decidied to not associated to my kientic structure as I thought it would better for me to understand arduino and further epand my knowledge in it so that I am able to later perform more complex projects that involve the use of other mechanisms. </p>

<h1> Schematic </h1>

<P> </P>

<h1> Code </h1>
<pre>
const int BUTTON1 = 2; 
const int BUTTON2 = 4; 
const int LED1 = 8; 
const int LED2 = 12; 
int BUTTONstate1 = 0; 
int BUTTONstate2 = 0;

void setup (){
  pinMode(BUTTON1, INPUT); 
  pinMode(BUTTON2, INPUT); 
  pinMode(LED1, OUTPUT); pinMode(LED2, OUTPUT);
   } 

  void loop() { 
     BUTTONstate1 = digitalRead(BUTTON1); 
     if (BUTTONstate1 == HIGH) { digitalWrite(LED1, HIGH); 
     } 
     else{ digitalWrite(LED1, LOW); }
      BUTTONstate2 = digitalRead(BUTTON2);
       if (BUTTONstate2 == HIGH) 
       { digitalWrite(LED2, HIGH); }
        else{ digitalWrite(LED2, LOW); 
        
        } 
        }

</pre>

<p> This is the code that I used for my project that works when button 1is pressed, then LED 1 will be turn on , but if the statement inside the if is wronng then LED 1 will be turn off. Now, if button 2 is pressed, then LED 2 will //be turn on but if the staement in the if confition is wrong, the LED 2 remains closes </p>



<h1> Testing its Effectiveness </h1>

<p> Before doing the circuit with two LEDs and pushbuttons, I first did a circuit with only one, but wntedto challenge myself and see how two would work and how the code would change in response to the addition of commmands. Below, I have attached a video and an image of the final circuit. </p>
