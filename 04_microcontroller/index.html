<h1> Week 4 :Microcontroller Programming
 </h1>
<p> For this week's assignment we had to program an Arduino board to do something. It should include a code snippets in the documnetation, a drawn schematic of the circuit using hand sketch, flastad or others  </p>

<h1> "True or False" </h1>

<h4> Materials Used </h4>
-Arduino 
- Wires 
- Breadboard 
- Button x2
- Green Light 
- Red Light 

<h4> Introduction </h4>

Since I had the option to program an Arduino Board to do something, I thought it would be really cool to do a true or false game, and decided to build on that. i decidied to not associated to my kientic structure as I thought it would better for me to understand arduino and further epand my knowledge in it so that I am able to later perform more complex projects that involve the use of other mechanisms.
