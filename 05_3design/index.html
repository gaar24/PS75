<h1> Week 5 :3D Design & Printing 
 </h1>
<p> For this week's assignment we had to design and print either a component that I will need for my final projector a small object that could not be easily made by substractive method. Then, we had to scan something using any photogrammetry application.  </p>

<h1> "The shoe horn" </h1>

<h4> Materials Used </h4>
-Prusa Slicer Software 
- Fusion 360 Software 
- 3D Printer 

<h4> Introduction </h4>

I really wanted to think broader and design something I could adapt to a challenge that perhaps I face throughout the day. Then, I thought that sometimes when I put a shoe that is to rigid due to its material, it can be hard to put it on. That is why, I created a show horn witht the hope to fix this problem.

<h4> Photogrammetry </h4>
 For this part of the assignment, I decided to use "Polycam", and scan my body lotion. I must admit that it wasn't that bad, as it was even able to capture the letters of the bottle, which I foudn really cool.
