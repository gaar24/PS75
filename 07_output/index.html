<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 208%; height: 1%; "> Assignment </h1>
<p> For this weeks assignment we had to use an output device that I havent used and write a microcontroller program that integrates at least one input device and one output device. Then, use an oscilliscioe to discover the time domain at which the output device is operating.  </p>

<h1> Materials Used </h1>
<p> USB, Potentiometer ( capable of regulating the intensity of the current that circuates through the circuit9, pushbutton, buzzer, breadboard, wires, arduino program </p>

<h1> Music Player </h1>
<p> I decided to build a program capable of playing " Happy Birthday" throughout the buzzer. For that, I started by playing with other output devices learned in class, such as the RGB LEDs, LED strip. Then,  I started to make my music player that when you press the pushbutton, Happy Birthday song will start playing and it can be regulated with a potentiometer. Before this, I actually had to learn how to use the buzzerm and it wasnt that hard and so due to the fact that the buzzer would not stop making noises, I decided to add a pushbutton. To do this, I put the potentiometer in the center of the breadboard so that I could connect pin 12 to the middle lead and the other two leads to the speaker. Next, I add a pusbutton. I coonected one lead with pin 3 and the other to GND. Finally, I connected one lead to GND of the arduino board. I then made sure that all the connections were good to go abd connected the hardware to the software. 
For the code, I decided to do it by myself and basically started by declaring variables for the musical notes of my song. Before starting I added "int" which basically means integer and is the data type for number storage. Then, for my first note which was g4, i added its correpsonding frequency that took from a table, in this case, 392. I then did the same with all the notes. Afterwards, I declared the variables for duration measured in milliseconds, and "void setup". Lastly, I added the whole code of my song into the void loop space.

<h1> Performance </h1>
<p> I would definetely say that the electronci output ended up being succesful. It ended up having 8 measures, 5 different pitches, and 3 different note durations. Here you will find my Arduino Performance. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ldNuoTcOc5uuXRxoRjaprVY5fS3kSSUs/view?t=6s"> here </a> </p>

<p> Also, this is the code I programmed:</p>
<p> <pre>
  

int pin= 12;
int buttonpin = 3;

int g4=392;
int a4=440;
int c5= 523;
int d5=587;
int g5=784;
int e5=659;
int f5=699;
int b4=494;

int beat16=150;
int beat8=2*beat16;
int beatd8= 3*beat16;
int beat4=4*beat16;
int beatd4=6*beat16;
int beat2=8*beat16;
int beatd2=12*beat16;
int beat1=16*beat16;

void setup(){



pinMode (pin, OUTPUT);
pinMode (buttonpin, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop (){


if(digitalRead(buttonpin)==LOW)
{
  for(int i=0; i<3; i++)
  {
    tone (pin,g4);
    delay(beatd8);
    noTone(pin);

    tone(pin,g4);
    delay(beat16);
    noTone(pin);

    tone(pin,a4);
