<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 200%; height: 2%; "> Assignment</h1>
<p> For this weeks assignment we had to design something and make it using CNC, and create something by molding and casting.   </p>

<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 200%; height: 2%; "> CNC Milling</h1>

 <h1>  Materials </h1>
<p> ShopBot, jpeg converted into dfx and scroll saw.   </p>

<h1>  Introduction </h1>
<p> Since the deadline for the final project is really close to the fair, I wanted to do this assignment so that I could implemented in my showcase. For that, since I am building a robotic arm that is able to serve tea, I wanted to do a sign that infered this. I called it "TeaBot" </p>

<h1>  The Process </h1>
<p> For this project, I started by using "PhotoShop" to make my design. Then, watched several youtube tutorials to conevrt a jpeg into dfx, and did it. </p>

<p> I then imported my dxf file into the Aspirr Software, and selected what I wanted to raster. Not gonna lie, this part of using the ShopBot was hard, specially without previous knowledge on how to use this sort of artifact. But I guess I did it! </p>

(image=)

<p> Once it was all raster, I removed the wood and since it was a huge piece, I used the scroll saw to cut my desire piece in the dimensions that I wished.</p>

<h1>  Materials </h1>
<p> Fusion 360, 3D printer, Plaster  </p>

<h1>  Introduction </h1>
<p> Due to the fact that I am always loosing my keys, I realize that this wekk assignment was the perfect time to fix this problem. So, decided to create a mold of a keychain that has a unique feature, a star.  </p>

<h1>  The Process </h1>
<p> For this project, I started by creating my mold with Fusion 360 (it took me more than expected, as I was trying to figure out a way to get 30 more days of free trial)  </p>

<p> Anyway, send it to the 3D printer that took around an hour and a half to print, and proceed to mix equal part, A and B by volume to get the desired material to be able to make the mold.   </p>


<p> Finally, i let the mixture sit in to mold all the night so that is hard enought to be used in the final project.   </p>


<p> Finally,I used the plaster and added it to the shape inside the mold.   </p>
