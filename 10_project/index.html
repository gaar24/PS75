<p> After thinking for four whole weeks, and changing the idea of my project several times thorughout the course of the course, I ended up with the perfect idea. The decision of designing a robotic arm was due to my motivation to integrate technology into mundane chores, such as tea making so that we can enjou moments of relaxation while being free from daily tasks. 
</p>

<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 200%; height: 7%; "> TeaBot: The Journey of a Robotic Arm to Serve the Perfect Cup of Tea. </h1>
<p> The daily ritual of tea, has been done for centuries due to its ability to provide a moment of relaxation, and this tradition has been brought into the future. One of the main features that makes this robotic arm unique, is that it is portable and easy to carry around. The dimensions and shape are ideal to be used. Below, you can see a demo of how it functions and perhaps as an inspirational source to construct your own.  </p>

<h1>  Process </h1>
<p> First thing, it is necessary to measure the servo motor and screws so that everything can fit perfectly and construct the pieces in Fusion 360. For this, I used callipers and a ruler. </p>


<p> Then, we will need to sketch the dimensions that we will need for each part of the robotic arm, as well as for the base where the robotic arm will be placed, and the drawers where the teabout will pick the tea bag and sugar from. Here, you will find an image with the dimensions shown. </p>


<p> Afterwards, we will export those sketches in Fusion 3D as stl, and open in Prusa Slicer. For some pieces, it will be needed to add supports. Then, we will export as g file and 3D print the. If you dont want to use Fusion 360 at all, here you will find the files in stl with the pieces to directly put them in Prusa Slider. </p>

<p> Then, we will go ahead and start building the robotic arm. For that,  </p>
