<h1 style=" background-color: #b8a07e;color: whitesmoke; width: 200%; height: 5%; "> Inspiration </h1>
<p> After thinking for four whole weeks, and changing the idea of my project several times thorughout the course of the course, I ended up with the perfect idea. The decision of designing a robotic arm was due to my motivation to integrate technology into mundane chores, such as tea making so that we can enjou moments of relaxation while being free from daily tasks. 
</p>

<p> The daily ritual of tea, has been done for centuries due to its ability to provide a moment of relaxation, and this tradition has been brought into the future. One of the main features that makes this robotic arm unique, is that it is portable and easy to carry around. The dimensions and shape are ideal to be used. Below, you can see a demo of how it functions and perhaps as an inspirational source to construct your own.  </p>

<h1>  Process </h1>
<p> First thing I did was to measure the servo motor and screws so so that everything could fit perfectly. Then,  model the pieces I will need in Fusion 360, and then exported those as stl and opened it on Prusa Slicer, where apart from preparing them to print, I added supports everywhere. Then, I proceed to export it as a g file and send it to the 3D printer. To 3D print just the arm of the robot, which was 6 pieces, it took me around 6 hours.  </p>


<p> Then, I went on and start by placing the servos in the right spaces and tight it with screws to the piece as hard as i could to make the robotic arm stable and functional. (this is actually realli important, because when running the code it can move really weird).  </p>


<p> Afterwards, I connected each servo to the breadboard, as there wasn't an arduino shield ( which would have looked much neat in terms of wires). So, I then connected to pins 11, 10, 9, 6,3 and proceed to callibrate the servo motor so that they could be all at 90 degrees. For this, I had to run the program for each servo motor, and then remove the piece attach to eat and move it to 90 degrees. I then did the same with all the servos except with the tongs. For this one, I placed the wheel on the last two teeths of the tong and callibrate it with an initial position of 180. </p>

<p> Once all the servos were pretty much callibrated, I went ahead and start coding the code. it took me apporximately one week and a half as I had to make sure that the angles of each of the parts of the robotic arm were adjust correctly so that it was able to pick up the tea and sugars from the drawers. Here is the code.  </p>

<p> For the code. I started by declaring the initail value position of each of the servos and on void setup its respective pins. </p>
